    <h3>
      ANNUAL MEETING.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our annual meeting at Lowell, Mass., October 23d to 25th,
      promises to be an occasion of great interest. A large proportion
      of the addresses will be from missionaries. The work throughout
      the year has been greatly blessed, despite the difficulties it
      has had to meet from lack of adequate means. The meeting opens at
      three o'clock, Tuesday afternoon, and the annual sermon will be
      given by Rev. Charles H. Richards, D.D., of Philadelphia, in the
      evening, followed by the communion service.
    </p>
    <hr class="short" />
    <h4>
      ARRANGEMENTS FOR OUR ANNUAL MEETING.
    </h4>
    <p>
      A partial and tentative programme of our Annual Meeting has been
      prepared. Times are provided for open discussion or the "free
      parliament." But it is deemed necessary to secure some able
      writers and speakers to prepare reports and deliver addresses on
      special and important topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are happy to announce that at this writing a number such have
      promised attendance. Among these we may name the President of the
      Association, Merrill E. Gates, LL.D., President of Amherst
      College; Rev. Chas. M. Lamson, D.D., Hartford, Conn.; Rev. DeW.
      S. Clark, Salem, Mass.; Rev. Dr. McKenzie, of Boston; Dr. Lyman
      Abbott, of New York; Hon. Frederick Douglass, of Washington; and
      his Excellency, Governor Greenhalge, of Massachusetts. Some
      others have been invited from whom favorable answers are
      expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      A marked feature of this meeting will be the unusual number of
      missionaries and workers from the field, who will give living
      pictures of things as they are. Following the happy precedent of
      other years, each of the co-operative Congregational societies
      will be represented by a speaker <!-- Page 346 --><a name=
      "Page_346" id="Page_346"></a>chosen by itself. These addresses
      will be brief, and will manifest the feelings of harmony and
      comity existing between these societies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting promises to be an interesting and valuable one. The
      topics discussed are of vital importance to the work, and the
      addresses will be worthy of the topics. Lowell is accessible, and
      its welcome will be cordial.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>
      LOWELL.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The city of Lowell has long enjoyed a national, even world-wide
      reputation, as the leading center for the manufacture of cotton
      fabrics. And, while this industry offers employment to something
      like 25,000 men, women and children, there are also enterprises
      in great variety that do not use cotton fibre in any way, yet
      find work for ten to fifteen thousand more toilers. The principal
      corporations are the Lawrence, Tremont and Suffolk, Merrimack,
      Boott, Massachusetts, Hamilton and Appleton, beside the
      Middlesex, where shawls are made, and the carpet mills, where the
      famous Lowell carpets are woven. While the city is a veritable
      beehive of industry, yet the people find time for recreation, and
      have wisely provided breathing places in different parts of the
      city, where they can recuperate mind and body. The prominent
      pleasure resorts are Fort Hill park, the North and South commons,
      Park Garden, the boulevard&mdash;extending three miles along the
      bank of the Merrimack River&mdash;and Lakeview, an attractive
      watering-place some five miles out from the center. This latter
      place is reached by means of the Lowell and Suburban Street
      Railway, an electric line, which also connects the neighboring
      villages of North Chelmsford, Dracut, North Billerica and
      Chelmsford Center. A ride to any one of these places costs but
      twenty cents for the round trip, and the Lakeview line is
      especially interesting at its terminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city's moral and educational interests are also well provided
      for, as evidenced by the following: 30 churches, 47 primary
      schools, 10 grammar and 1 high school, besides a training school
      for teachers, and a manual training-school for boys; also a
      prospective State normal school. We also have three or four
      hospitals, an old ladies' home, and a home for young women and
      children. The police protection consists of a chief, his
      deputies, captains and sergeants, and about one hundred
      patrolmen. The fire system of the city is excelled by none in the
      country, and is well worthy a careful inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lowell is not favored with a great many pretentious edifices on
      her public streets, but the most prominent are the new City Hall,
      High School, Memorial Building, State Armory, St. Anne's Church
      and the Federal Building. The city is already furnished with a
      thorough water system, but, desiring a better quality of water
      than that taken from the Merrimack River, she has had a large
      number of artesian wells driven, and they now
      <!-- Page 347 --><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a>furnish
      about 3,000,000 gallons of water per day. All the principal
      streets are well lighted by electric lamps, and the residential
      portion by gas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Merrimack River affords a means of enjoying aquatic sports,
      there being rowing boats, canoes, sail boats and steamers in
      abundance. Two very enchanting spots up the river are Tyng's
      Island and Harmony Grove, and if one desire a longer trip by
      water he may ride to Nashua, N.H., by steamer or other boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The population of Lowell is probably about 80,000, and excepting
      in specially hard times there are few persons to be found in want
      of a situation. These are only a few of Lowell's salient points,
      but enough is here given to convey to the visitor a very fair
      idea of the city's make-up.

    <h3>
      FINANCIAL STATEMENT.
    </h3>
    <p>
      We wish to present to the friends of the American Missionary
      Association a full statement of its financial affairs, its debt,
      its retrenchments; its still greater debt and the still greater
      retrenchments that will be inevitable unless during the coming
      year its receipts can be greatly increased. It is not our aim to
      make a startling cry for transient relief, but for a steady
      increase of receipts to remove debt and insure the stability of
      the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close of our last fiscal year, September 30th, 1893, we
      reported a debt of $45,028.11. In that year we received aid from
      the Government for Indian work. During the eleven months of this
      year we have received no aid from the Government, but our
      receipts from other sources have increased over those of last
      year, and we have cut down our expenditures, so that if we had
      received the Government aid as last year our debt on the eleven
      months of the current year would be only $5,409.80, but with that
      loss the actual indebtedness of these eleven months is
      $23,937.10, which added to that of the last year makes the total
      debt August 31st $68,965.21. From present indications we can
      hardly hope for any material reduction of this amount during the
      current month, and hence the prospect is that this sum must be
      reported at our annual meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      A grave contingency confronts us as we enter (October 1st) on the
      new year. Our great work, which has lifted thousands of young men
      and women from ignorance and poverty into hopeful and useful
      lives, and which has brought cheer and help to multitudes of
      homes where poverty has reigned, must be carried forward; and our
      debt, which has hung as a weight upon this work, must be wiped
      out. A constantly increasing debt must be avoided at any cost.
      The next six or eight months (the harvest months for collections)
      must decide the question. If pastors of churches will lay the
      matter to heart and secure regular and increased collections, and
      if benevolent friends of these struggling races will bear them in
      remembrance by special contributions, an uplift of hope and help
      will be <!-- Page 348 --><a name="Page_348" id=
      "Page_348"></a>given where now they are threatened with
      discouragement in their great conflict with poverty, ignorance
      and race prejudice.

    <h3>
      CAPITAL AND LABOR.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Capital and labor are twin brothers, but they have been alienated
      almost from childhood, and the strife between them waxes warmer
      and warmer, and, like all other vexed questions, will never be
      settled till it is settled right.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are various forms of these troubles&mdash;now in the coal
      mines, now on the railroads, and now in the shops&mdash;but there
      are aspects of the struggle which put on national traits and
      overthrow empires. The French Revolution was a struggle between
      capital and labor. The capitalists were the aristocracy, and they
      monopolized also intelligence and power. With these advantages
      they ground down labor till patience was changed to implacable
      rage, and the reaction brought forth the most serious and
      terrible massacres recorded in history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our great civil war of 1861-65 developed one aspect of the
      conflict between capital and labor. The slaveholders were the
      capitalists, and with them also were the intelligence and power.
      These levers were used to crush down the laborer into the
      severest form of slavery known among men. Labor was patient, but
      large sympathy was developed in the North in favor of the slave.
      This alone would not have brought on the war. Southern
      capitalists gloried in their power, and, accustomed to absolute
      domination over their slaves, assumed the same attitude of
      superiority over their fellow-citizens of the North. They ruled
      in Congress, dominated over the press and the pulpit, and,
      ambitious to extend their dominion, demanded larger territory for
      the extension of the slave system. When this was refused, they
      set up an independent standard and brought on the war. The end
      was disastrous to the South. The capitalists were well-nigh
      ruined and the slaves were set free.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this same plain, growing out of the embers of that same
      conflict, another and almost as threatening a struggle is rising
      up before us. The white race in the South still largely controls
      capital, intelligence and power, and these forces are again used
      to hinder the impoverished laborer. The white man holds office,
      from which the black man is excluded, who is denied opportunities
      and privileges which crush his manhood. The contest is again
      unequal, and the outcome must take one of two forms. Either the
      oppressed laborer will rise in rebellion&mdash;and whatever may
      be the ultimate result the conflict will be dreadful&mdash;or, on
      the other hand, the laborer, denied education, a comfortable home
      and a chance to accumulate property, will sink into an utterly
      hopeless degradation, a curse to himself and to the whole South.
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- Page 349 --><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the remedy for all this? There is a remedy, and if
      applied promptly may save the nation from either of the
      catastrophes we have named, and that is: Give the black man a
      chance to acquire property, education and power equal to his
      white neighbor, and the elements of the struggle are gone. This
      is the work the American Missionary Association is attempting to
      do. It meddles not with theories, or parties, but aims quietly to
      give the needed help to the Negro.

    <h3>
      OUR ALASKA MISSION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Letters received from Rev. Dr. Sheldon Jackson and Mr. Lopp give
      us the gratifying assurance that the mission is by this time
      opened under favorable auspices. Dr. Jackson found on reaching
      Alaska that Mr. Lopp had visited the mission at Cape Prince of
      Wales this spring and discovered that the buildings, furniture
      and supplies were in good condition. Mr. Lopp, in response to our
      request, has consented to return to the Cape and re-open the
      mission. He greatly regrets that an ordained minister was not
      sent, and expresses the earnest hope that another season this
      necessary addition will be made, but he consents to return and do
      the best he can. He has little fear of violence from the natives,
      finding them completely intimidated by the threats of the captain
      of the revenue cutter "Bear."
    </p>
    <p>
      The experiment of introducing the reindeer into Alaska is thus
      far very encouraging. Mr. Lopp has had a herd under his care at
      Port Clarence, and although the winter has been unusually severe
      one hundred and fifty fawns were added to the herd. The
      Government has promised to our mission at Cape Prince of Wales
      this season one hundred reindeer, and Mr. Lopp, with adequate
      help, will have the care of them. The ultimate success of this
      experiment with reindeer in Alaska is one of great promise. It
      indicates a food and clothing supply for the natives, with
      increased facilities for transportation, thus laying the
      foundation for growth in population and in civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be remembered that of the three men connected with the
      horrible murder of Mr. Thornton, two were at once arrested by the
      natives and shot. The third, Titalk, who was the leader, escaped
      for the time. Mr. Lopp thus describes his death: "After the
      'Bear' had left for the South, Titalk came back to the cape, and
      his uncle, Te-ed-loo-na led him up on the hillside near the grave
      of Mr. Thornton, and asked him how he should put him to death,
      strangle him, stab him or shoot him. The boy preferred to be
      shot, so he commanded him to hold his head down and then shot
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lopp furnishes another evidence of the disposition on the
      part of the leading natives to guard the interests and property
      of the mission: "On one occasion during the winter Chief Eliguok
      heard that a boy had <!-- Page 350 --><a name="Page_350" id=
      "Page_350"></a>broken into the school-house, and he announced his
      intention to kill the boy, but upon investigation it was found to
      be a false report."
    </p>
    <p>
      We trust that in the good providence of God, this mission will be
      made prosperous and be greatly enlarged, that its missionaries
      will be preserved in safety, that the natives will become more
      orderly, that the influence of the school and mission may bring
      to them peaceable fruits of civilization and Christianity.

      August. Memorial services were held on the 26th of August in the
      church where he had long and faithfully conducted the worship of
      his people. Addresses were made by those who had been intimately
      associated with him in his work, which testified to the
      earnestness and success of his ministry. The best proof of his

    <p>
      Our field missionary in a recent visit speaks in this way: "It is
      very rare to find colored people under such discipline and so
      orderly and intelligent in meetings. The faces of the old people
      are sunny and sweet, they are so attentive and appreciative and
      so responsive. The young people were at the meeting in large
      numbers. It will give you an uplift from your work to spend a day
      or two with the people of this place in meetings such as they now
      hold."

    <h3>
      THE WALDENSES AT VALDESE, N.C.
    </h3>
    <p class="author">
      SECRETARY C.J. RYDER.
    </p>
    <p>
      This new field of work, which was reported for the first time at
      our annual meeting last year, is one of unique and especial
      interest. Two years ago the steamship Kaiser Wilhelm arrived in
      New York with one hundred and sixty-six Waldenses among her
      steerage passengers. These people came from the Piedmont valley
      and mountain regions of Italy. Their purpose in coming to America
      was to establish for themselves homes in our own mountain region
      of the South. This little company that came down from the deck of
      the Kaiser Wilhelm were the pioneers in the establishment of
      their colonies in this new land. They were rather the Pilgrim
      Fathers of this Waldensean movement. Before the actual colonists
      had come, Rev. Chas. A. Tron, D.D., pastor of the Waldensean
      Church, and member of the Board of Evangelization in Italy, had
      been to the mountain regions of North Carolina, and after careful
      investigation had purchased a tract of land for these Waldensean
      colonists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after the coming of these Waldenses, correspondence was
      opened with them by the American Missionary Association. The
      colony was to be planted in the midst of our great mountain
      field, and we had every confidence that the coming of these
      conscientious and devoted Christian colonists would be of real
      helpfulness in our work there. Rev. C.M. Prochet, D.D., whose
      name is well known to the readers of this magazine, and to the
      Christian public generally, came to look after the interests of
      the Waldensean colony not long after their first settlement. In
      conference with Drs. Tron and Prochet, and after learning
      thoroughly the condition of their colony, an appropriation was
      voted by the Executive Committee to assist them in the beginning
      of their work, as they were in great need of such help.
    </p>
    <p>
      These Waldenses have begun their settlement in America in a wise
      and sensible way. Let us notice their business-like arrangement
      before speaking of the interesting educational and religious work
      which has developed among them with the assistance of the
      Association.
    </p>
    <p>
      They have purchased five thousand acres of land. In dividing this
      land, they first set aside a portion for a church and manse,
      together with a small farm for the use of the pastor. Then they
      set aside a good, commodious site for the school-house. After
      this a considerable portion of the land, three thousand five
      hundred acres in extent, is divided into farms of fifty acres
      each.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to this first company who came on the Kaiser Wilhelm,
      others have come at various times until there is a considerable
      colony there. <!-- Page 352 --><a name="Page_352" id=
      "Page_352"></a>These people are poor. They come from the splendid
      stock of Waldenses who have been so potent a factor in freeing
      thousands in France and Italy from the degrading superstitions of
      Romanism. As all our readers know, the Waldenses have stood for
      religious freedom from first to last The fibre of their character
      has been tested through many a conflict. Dr. Edward Everett Hale,
      who told the story of the Waldensean heroism and devotion in the
      beautiful legend "In His Name," brings out the noble features of
      their character in soft, yet bright colors. It is most fitting
      that our Congregational churches through the Association should
      welcome this new colony and extend to them the right hand of
      Christian fellowship. This they have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the colony was established and the people were felling
      the forests and building their humble homes, they applied to us
      for assistance for the support of the pastor and teacher. The
      colonists themselves made large sacrifices, and only asked us to
      assist them in the support of their religious and educational
      leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rev. Enrico Vinay, a native of Italy, was their first pastor. Mr.
      M.A. Jahier, was selected as their teacher. Mr. Jahier, together
      with Dr. Tron, was in conference with us in New York, and the
      simple, Christian character and progressive educational ideas of
      the Waldensean teacher charmed and impressed us all. He went into
      the field and opened a school and Sunday-school at Valdese, as
      the colonists call their mountain village.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. Enrico Vinay remained with the people for nearly a year,
      being in regular correspondence with the officers of this
      Association. He was then called to another field, and Rev. B.
      Soulier was chosen as their pastor. Mr. Soulier is also a native
      of Italy. He is a thoroughly educated young man, and speaks
      English readily. He was educated in his own school in Italy, and
      completed a course at Edinburgh University in Scotland. His work
      is proving most successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the interesting and providential beginning of our work in
      conjunction with these Waldenses in this field. We have this new
      problem upon our hearts and treasury. Who can say that God has
      not led us into this work, and opened this opportunity for
      helpful and sympathetic co-operation with these earnest Christian
      people who have settled in our southern mountains?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the reports which have been regularly received from this
      field, very many items of great interest have been recorded. The
      Waldenses, above everything else, are Christian patriots. They
      love the fatherland and they love also America, the land of their
      adoption. In one of the reports from Mr. Jahier, the following
      interesting information is given:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sunday, June 24th, I preached to a good and attentive
      congregation. I had the Sunday-school at half past eight and the
      preaching at ten in the morning, and prayer-meeting at four in
      the afternoon. At this last service I went to a farm called
      Baziglia. It is named for a place in one of
      <!-- Page 353 --><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a>the valleys
      of Piedmont&mdash;a place which is noted as a fortress during the
      persecutions of the Waldensean Church. It was the refuge of the
      Waldenseans when they reconquered their native country after
      their exile in Switzerland, Germany, etc., and in memory of that
      famous place, two or three families gave to their farms the same
      name. The Fourth of July was celebrated here at the school-house.
      There were forty-four children. I spoke to them of the
      independence of the United States of America, its founders, its
      Declaration of Independence, etc. For July and August it is
      impossible to have the day school; it is too hot, but I will
      continue the night school, D.V., at least for two or three nights
      a week. The Sunday-school will go on as usual&mdash;no vacation
      for the Sabbath school."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old fortress of Baziglia witnessed many heroic efforts of the
      early Waldenses, both in defense and attack. The name is very
      dear to the children of the earlier heroes, who have established
      Valdese in this land, and so named some of their farms and homes
      Baziglia. The glimpse given us in the quotation above, of the
      life in this Waldensean colony, is an impressive picture and a
      most hopeful prophecy. These Waldenses can not prove "dangerous
      foreigners" who come to our shores with earnest Christian plans
      and purposes, and read the Declaration of Independence to their
      children on their first Fourth of July in America!
    </p>
    <p>
      Photographs of the buildings at Valdese were recently sent to our
      office. Among others was one of the manse and one of the
      school-house. These two buildings are of especial interest to our
      constituency, because we help the pastor and teacher. Over the
      school-house in which our pupils gather was floating the stars
      and stripes. These earnest people who celebrate the Fourth of
      July, who read publicly our Declaration of Independence, who
      plant the stars and stripes on the top of their school building,
      are the kind of foreigners that we need, and they certainly merit
      our most cordial assistance in the beginning of their life in our
      land.
    </p>
    <p>
      In church polity the Waldensean Church differs slightly from our
      Congregational sisterhood. The local church is independent in the
      direction of its affairs. They have a "Board of Evangelization"
      which has supervision of their churches. Dr. Tron, a member of
      this board and president of the American branch, has properly
      great influence with the local church. The Waldensean Church
      naturally looks to Dr. Tron and Dr. Prochet for counsel and
      direction. This church at Valdese recognizes itself as in
      fellowship with our great Congregational body, and especially
      with the local churches of North Carolina.
    </p>
    <p>
      This new and interesting field has opened more and more largely
      during the past year, as additional colonists have come to our
      shores. Despite the financial embarrassment of our treasury, we
      rejoice that we have been able to assist these brave and
      patriotic Christian people in establishing themselves in this
      mountain region of the South. We believe the opportunity of
      assistful co-operation with them is one that God has opened to
      <!-- Page 354 --><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a>us. We have
      every confidence that the descendants of Pilgrims and Puritans
      will rejoice in the privilege of assisting those in whose hearts
      there is the same passionate desire for religious freedom, and
      who are the children of equally heroic stock.

      NOTES FROM THE MOUNTAINS.
    </h3>
    <p class="author">
      BY MISSIONARY WALTON.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of my visits to a neglected home I found a little orphan
      boy of ten years whom I invited to our mission Sunday-school, and
      he seemed pleased to know he had a friend. I had told them,
      during my visits, of our little Sunday-school, and as I was
      leaving I gave him a little Sunday-school card with a beautiful
      verse of scripture and asked him if he could read, whereupon, he
      answered, "No;" then I asked his foster-mother if she would teach
      him the text&mdash;she promised, as by this time she too was
      getting interested. I left them seemingly glad for the little
      time I had spent with them in their home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after this I was going down town, moving briskly along,
      when a small boy came plump up against me, saying, "Hello,
      mister! don't you know me? You're the Sunday-school man which was
      to our house. I know you." "O yes, I know you now," and I said,
      "tell me about yourself." "I have been to Sunday-school four
      Sundays, and have a nice teacher, and enjoy going very much; we
      are in a little class and have lesson-picture papers, and I like
      it so much I want to go every Sunday and all the time. I know a
      boy who does not go to Sunday-school, and he has promised to go
      with me next Sunday."
    </p>
    <p>
      Saturday evening, June 2d, it was my privilege to meet with the
      Mossy Grove Christian Endeavor Society. About forty-five young
      people were present and took a hearty part in the
      meeting&mdash;quite a number joined in prayer during the twenty
      minutes' prayer service. This service was all the more
      interesting because a work of our planting, and from a very small
      beginning has grown and is full of Christian earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the home of the "unfortunate man" I had found as I went
      through the mountains. It was my privilege to look into that
      man's face and note the change that had come to him. In the
      Sunday-school I was teacher of his class. He seemed interested in
      the lesson and showed evidence of being a changed man. As I
      preached of the "sprinkled blood" he somehow appreciated all the
      more how he had been rescued. In the house-to-house work among
      this people I found many encouraging results and think our work
      there will develop until we have a church organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one county I found a number of people off by themselves in a
      little nook of a valley, but not over two miles from
      Sunday-school and church, <!-- Page 355 --><a name="Page_355" id=
      "Page_355"></a>yet not attending. As I went into their homes and
      talked about their opportunities and duties, many promises were
      given that the future would find them more active for themselves
      and children. One man who had not been in Sunday-school for four
      years made a humble confession, and pledged that he would go to
      work. He spoke of his early life with its Christian activities,
      and now when he has a family he has neglected to take them and go
      to the house of God. So many men are waiting for somebody to lead
      them to their duty&mdash;they see it and know it&mdash;but have
      not moral courage to go forward unless encouraged in some special
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Children's Day I was in Pleasant View, and am sure if our
      Northern friends could have looked in and have seen the bright,
      happy children that were engaged in their first Children's Day
      service they would have been encouraged and rejoiced. Of course
      the service was far from perfect, but while this was true they
      were having a new experience. I had told them about Children's
      Day, and urged them to use our order of exercises, which they
      did, but the songs and recitations were too hard for most of
      them; yet, as I saw the real effort and interest, I could not
      restrain the "well done." But this was not all; I was again to be
      surprised when the names were called and the "little envelopes"
      presented with their "little Children's Day offering." They were
      happy in the thought of doing something for the good people who
      had aided them. They are very poor people and cannot do much, but
      a great change has come over them since I first found them. Our
      Christian Endeavor meeting that day was one of profit and help to
      all. One little boy about ten years old led in prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the month there have been two hopeful conversions and many
      evidences of spiritual strengthening and growth. On the other
      hand, hundreds are waiting for some one to help them "while the
      water is troubled." In all the meetings of the month there has
      been a marked evidence of spiritual interest.

      "NOLICHUCKY JACK'S" DESCENDANTS.
    </h3>
    <p class="author">
      REV. JOS. E. ROY, D.D.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I had preached recently at Naperville, Ill., Sunday
      morning, upon our mountain work, using the big map, a couple of
      ladies came forward and introduced themselves as descendants of
      John Sevier, the Huguenot "commonwealth builder" in the mountains
      of Tennessee, the hero of King's Mountain, as I had represented
      him to be. One of the ladies was Mrs. Knickerbocker, her husband
      being one of the most respected citizens of that place&mdash;his
      own stock being that indicated by his name. She is now, as she
      has been for many years, the lady principal of the college in
      that town connected with the Evangelical Association Church. Her
      mother was a Sevier and her father, Rev. John Cunningham, a
      Presbyterian minister from Jonesboro, East Tennessee, who came
      early to Illinois to get away <!-- Page 356 --><a name="Page_356"
      id="Page_356"></a>from slavery, and who served acceptably that
      Congregational Church of Naperville. She was a granddaughter of
      John Sevier. The other descendant was Miss Sevier, a
      great-great-granddaughter, a cultivated young lady, who was a
      teacher in a college in Ohio.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at least a noticeable coincidence that out here upon these
      western prairies two of those worthy representatives should
      confront the preacher, who found his response to be, "Well, I
      didn't say anything bad about John Sevier, did I?" What a grand
      coalescing of blood was that which in the gathering of our nation
      brought Knickerbocker and Huguenot, Scotch, Irish and English and
      Germans, with congenial Danes and Swedes, into our people's life.
      It was also a bond of union, North and South, too strong to be
      separated by civil strife. It is an element in the make-up of the
      South that will ever be a conservative force in behalf of
      theology, of law and order, of Puritan institutions.

      PROMISING OPENINGS FOR SCHOOL AND CHURCH.
    </h3>
    <p class="author">
      FROM A MOUNTAIN MISSIONARY.
    </p>
    <p>
      I write to acquaint you with the facts concerning Columbus, N.C.,
      both as regards church and school work. You are already aware of
      the good work accomplished there by our Brother Olinger.
      Something like thirty young people were converted through his
      efforts, and now the call comes for the organization of a church.
      The only church organization there has monthly meetings only and
      a minister uneducated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The County Commissioners have signified their willingness to turn
      over the upper room in the Court House for church purposes, until
      some other arrangement could be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most active person in the new enterprise is a member of
      another denomination, but is in favor of a Congregational church,
      as it would most likely meet the wants of new-comers of different
      churches.
    </p>
    <p>
      As regards the school matter, I understand that a friend proffers
      to give to any church or individual who will establish and
      maintain a college an excellent site of ten acres, on a
      prominence affording a beautiful view of the surrounding country;
      and it is further reported that he will give, in addition to the
      site, one thousand dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Columbus is situated in a very thickly populated section of the
      country, and Mr. Stearns, of Cleveland, Ohio, has erected two
      school buildings suitable for primary work, and already has
      employed two Congregational teachers at his own expense. The
      results obtained after two years' work are marvelous, thus
      showing that the mountaineers are extremely anxious to obtain an
      education; and in proportion to the increase of facilities for so
      doing, the results would increase.

      SOUTHERN FIELD NOTES.
    </h3>
    <p class="author">
      BY REV. GEORGE W. MOORE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three thousand people were present at the Commencement exercises
      of LeMoyne Institute, Memphis. That vast audience paying an
      admission fee on an inclement evening to attend the
      closing-exercises gives evidence of the strong hold LeMoyne
      Institute has on the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The essays and orations were thoughtful addresses on the
      practical questions of the day. The meeting of the alumni
      association evinced the high regard in which Professor Steele and
      his corps of teachers are held by the graduates. The association
      expressed their intention to aid Professor Steele to sustain
      departments of the industrial work that had to be given up on
      account of hard times.
    </p>
    <p>
      An amusing and interesting incident, which illustrates the
      struggles of many of the parents to educate their children as
      well as their faith in God, occurred at the alumni dinner of Fisk
      University, Nashville, Tenn. At the close of the Commencement,
      Rev. H.H. Holloway, of Turin, Ga., the father of one of the
      graduates, was called upon for an after-dinner speech. Mr.
      Holloway told of a letter he received from President Cravath when
      he felt compelled, owing to the hard times, to have his son John,
      who had been in the University only four months, return home. Mr.
      Holloway, being unable to decipher the president's writing (the
      president's chirography resembles that of the late Horace
      Greeley&mdash;ED.), asked a Southern minister of his village to
      read it. The minister read the letter, and advised him not to
      waste his son's time with a college course; this did not prove
      good logic to Mr. Holloway, as he observed that this minister's
      son was taking a college course of study without wasting his
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will let Mr. Holloway tell the rest of the story of the letter
      and his prayer in his own words: "Not being satisfied with the
      minister's advice I went that night down into the woods and knelt
      beside a hickory-tree, with the letter spread out, and prayed as
      follows: 'Lord here is a letter from Dr. Cravath; I suppose you
      know him. Here is his letter which I cannot read, but I am told
      that you can read as well in the dark as you can in the light.
      Dr. Cravath says for me to do all I can for my son, and look to
      you for the balance. Now I cannot do anything for my son; if he
      is to be aided you must do all, for one thing is certain I have
      no money; you have left none with me, and I do not know with whom
      you have left it. Now, dear Lord, I leave this whole matter with
      you. In your own way and time do for my son what seems best. I
      cannot do anything. I ask it all for Jesus' sake. Amen.' I
      repeated about the same prayer the following night, and then left
      it all with the Lord. In about two weeks I received a letter from
      my son stating that some one had put two hundred and fifty
      dollars in the bank at Nashville to his account to aid him
      through college. I considered it the direct answer to my prayer.
      This is the proudest day of my life to see my son John graduate
      from <!-- Page 358 --><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a>Fisk
      University. May the blessing of God rest upon it and upon the
      Association which founded and fosters it."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an unusual number of the parents of the graduates at
      this Commencement. Some of the addresses and scenes recalled the
      words of the aged Simeon when our Lord was presented in the
      temple. There were fathers and mothers who at great sacrifice had
      come from Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Missouri and other States
      to see this famous school and witness the graduating exercises of
      their children. They spoke out of hearts full of gratitude to
      their Northern friends for making it possible for their children
      to fit themselves for their life-work in the schools of the
      American Missionary Association.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ordination service of special interest was held at Atlanta,
      Ga., in July, when Mr. H.H. Proctor was ordained to the gospel
      ministry as pastor of the First Church. He is twenty-five years
      old, one of "Uncle Tom's" sons, and is a graduate of Fisk
      University and Yale Divinity School. This was the first
      ordination held in this church, and the first Negro pastor to
      serve it, as all the former pastors were Northern men. Already
      all departments of the church have taken on new life, and the
      future is full of hope. This is one of our largest and most
      influential churches of the South, and starts out auspiciously
      with Pastor Proctor, as a self-supporting church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Second Church of Memphis, Tenn., which has been
      self-supporting for a number of years, reports a year of
      prosperity under its new pastor, Rev. George V. Clark. The
      building has been renovated, and over fifty persons added to the
      church. The church at Chattanooga, Tenn., with Rev. Jos. E. Smith
      as pastor, has made heroic struggles during these hard times as a
      self-supporting plant. At times the struggle has seemed greater
      than they could bear, but in the midst of all they have been
      cheered and sustained by the Lord. The new parsonage at Marietta,
      Ga., gives Pastor Lane a pleasant home. Our church at this point
      is near the Kenesaw Mountains, where Sherman shouted to his
      soldiers, "Hold the fort, for I am coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      The people at Louisville were glad to have the field missionary
      expound our New Testament polity to them at the second
      anniversary of the dedication of their chapel. Pastor Harris has
      some earnest workers in his church. Dr. Whedbee, the
      superintendent of the Sunday-school and the president of the
      Christian Endeavor, is a graduate from Howard University. He has
      an excellent practice, and is a devoted Christian worker.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must close these notes with an example of church work that
      shows what can be done in our Southern field when pastors and
      people have a wise direction and a mind to work. I find the
      following record in the minutes of the Tennessee Association for
      1893. "Nashville, Howard Chapel. The church is not prosperous.
      Services have been discontin<!-- Page 359 --><a name="Page_359"
      id="Page_359"></a>ued. An effort, however, is to be made to
      revive and develop the life and power of the church." This effort
      took form in the appointment by the Association of Rev. J.E.
      Moorland, of Washington, D.C., as pastor last October. The
      appointment was made for ten months, with a view of continuance
      if the work proved fruitful. What has been the result of these
      ten months just ended? The church has been revived, its
      membership increased to seventy-five, congregations large and
      growing, a nourishing Sunday-school and mission school, two
      preaching services on the Lord's day, and a vigorous Y.P.S.C.E.;
      a wide-awake mid-week service, a woman's missionary society, and
      a sewing-school for girls. The church edifice has been renovated
      at a cost of three hundred dollars, and a parsonage is being
      erected. For intelligence, Christian character and progressive
      work, this church is considered the best among colored people in
      the city.

    <h3>
      CAPPAHOSIC'S SIXTH COMMENCEMENT.
    </h3>
    <p class="author">
      BY DEACON SAMUEL HOLMES.
    </p>
    <p>
      May 31st was a proud day for Gloucester County, Va., for not only
      was Hon. Frederick Douglass to give the annual address, but the
      new dormitory called "Douglass Hall" was to be used for the first
      time. With only the roof on and but partially covered, still the
      lower story had been temporarily floored and seated so that a
      thousand persons could be accommodated. Although the previous
      twenty-four hours had been dark and rainy the crowd had been
      gathering all the time&mdash;many of whom accompanied the Holly
      Grove Brass Band in early morning to escort Mr. Douglass and
      other visitors from the river to the school building.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast the school went on with its regular forenoon
      work, interesting the visitors, who also inspected the barn, the
      workshops and farm. By noon the campus and vicinity was a
      wonderful sight, while the outskirts reminded one of an
      old-fashioned general training in Connecticut, with its booths
      and tables. An official count of teams on the campus as reported
      to me was, 357 horse, 7 mule teams, and 1 ox team. Many of these
      had driven fifty or sixty miles, and generally carrying the
      fodder behind or tied under the wagons. There were from 1,500 to
      2,000 people on the grounds and vicinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 1:30 p.m., after a well prepared lunch for the trustees and
      invited guests, they were escorted by the school, headed by the
      band, to the new hall, which was soon filled to its utmost
      capacity. With excellent music by the school and band, followed
      by prayer, came not the least important part of the programme,
      the collection and pledges towards completing the building.
      Including the admission fee of twenty-five cents from outsiders,
      the money raised was over three hundred dollars, besides over
      eight hundred dollars in good pledges, of which two hundred and
      fifty dollars were <!-- Page 360 --><a name="Page_360" id=
      "Page_360"></a>from Mr. Douglass and his relatives present. Then
      followed an address on "Self Help," by a young man graduate, and
      another by a young woman on "A New Picture," contrasting the
      present surroundings with the time when she first entered the
      school in its beginnings under Mr. Weaver, in a small log-house
      with one door and two windows. These addresses would have done
      credit to many older institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Douglass then followed with his incomparable lecture on
      "Self-Made Men." One could but feel in seeing his magnificent
      physique and his manly bearing as he proceeded, that he was a
      most notable example of his subject, while to report his lecture,
      with its impromptu sallies of wit and wisdom, would be almost
      impossible. He instanced many men as illustrations and especially
      interested his audience with stories of personal interviews with
      Lincoln, Seward, Greeley, Stanton, Grant and others during and
      after the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      But most thrilling was the story of a slave boy and his following
      him from his early years, his learning to read and write, his
      conversion and desire to become a preacher, praying for three or
      four years, every morning, noon and night, that God would set him
      free, and how that his prayers were not answered till he prayed
      with his heels. At about seventeen years he ran away, reaching
      Massachusetts, where he publicly told his story, till, hearing
      that the slave catchers were after him, he fled to England, where
      he lectured till his English friends purchased him from his late
      master for $750, when he returned to his native land and worked
      in the anti-slavery cause till by the war every bondman was free.
      He has since served his country as U.S. Minister to Hayti, U.S.
      Marshal at Washington, and in other positions of trust, and also
      tried to serve his race to the best of his ability. It needed not
      that he should further identify himself, but if so he could do it
      by the scars on his back and the "bill of sale" of himself in his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Douglass believed most heartily in Cappahosic, and has two
      very efficient granddaughters there, one at the head of the
      culinary department, and the other as teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Short addresses followed by Rev, Mr. Spiller, of Hampton, Va.,
      Mr. Lewis Douglass, and the editor of the <i>Afro-American</i>,
      Rev. M. Alexander, of Baltimore, Md. The writer told of, and is
      glad here to bear witness to, the noble, self-denying labors of
      Mr. and Mrs. Weaver and their corps of teachers and scholars
      during these struggling years, as also to the growing and earnest
      help of the people around them in sustaining the school to so
      large a degree. They appreciate most highly the fostering care
      and help of this Association, and hope that within a few years
      they may be able to take the entire pecuniary burdens upon
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Holmes told of the breaking of the ground for the new
      building last winter, under very trying difficulties, with little
      to draw upon but their oft-proved Bank of Faith and Prayer, and
      of Mr. Weaver's coming <!-- Page 361 --><a name="Page_361" id=
      "Page_361"></a>North for help, and his return, telling his wife
      he hardly ever felt so discouraged. She handed him a letter which
      came in his absence. On opening it, he exclaimed, "Bless the
      Lord! here is a check for $250." Reading the letter, he shouted,
      "Praise the Lord! it is $2,500," and he has been praising Him
      ever since and praying for more, for he needs about twice as much
      to complete and furnish the building, which is 70x46 feet, and
      three stories high.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people of Gloucester and adjacent counties have taken about a
      dozen rooms to finish and furnish at a cost of $50 to $100 each,
      and yet there will be many more wanted by the boys for the coming
      winter. All the work, including the plans and supervision, has
      been done by colored men, assisted quite largely by the boys of
      the school. Who will supplement the magnificent gift of Mrs.

      A PRAYERFUL AND INDUSTRIOUS FAMILY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      One of our deacons is the father and grandfather of a large
      number of people among whom he lives, and by whom he is greatly
      honored. He and his aged wife, who is good as can be, like
      himself, toil for their living all the week, and walk six miles
      Sunday morning to church. Sometimes she fails, for she is not
      quite so strong as her husband, but he is seldom absent. One of
      his sons-in-law, who has himself a son in Talladega College, is
      the most prompt and regular attendant the church has, and he
      comes the same six miles. These are not only faithful in church
      attendance, but are also to be counted among the truest of
      upright, honest, pure, industrious people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between twenty and twenty-five years ago, when they did not have
      homes of their own, they rented of a man, who, like Shylock,
      would hold them close to their bargain. One year the "destroyer"
      came, and crops were short everywhere. When the day was at hand
      for the landlord to come with his wagons for his share of the
      crop, they were greatly distressed. Acting upon the advice of a
      Christian woman, who was among them as their first teacher, they
      observed a day of rigid fasting and earnest prayer. "They were
      heard in that they feared." The dreaded day arrived; the man came
      with his wagons. In fear and trembling they turned everything
      over to him, but to their surprise he kindly said that he knew it
      had been a bad year. His crops, also, had been ruined. He loaded
      up a little, but left them enough for seed another year, and
      something to live on besides, and drove most of his wagons home
      empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      For twenty-one or twenty-two years on the anniversary of that
      fast day all work has stopped, and a fast as rigid as the first,
      with special religious services, has been kept, and on June 21st
      a day of thanksgiving. On the first, which is in February, they
      ask for God's special blessing on <!-- Page 362 --><a name=
      "Page_362" id="Page_362"></a>the seed about to be planted, and on
      the work of their hands for the year, and on the day in June they
      praise the Lord for what prosperity they have enjoyed in the
      past. It was my privilege to attend both of these anniversaries
      this year. I found the people earnest, intelligent and
      <i>strictly moral</i>. These people appreciate the American
      Missionary Association and her work in their behalf. It would be
      long before they could themselves sustain such institutions as
      the Association has placed among them, but they are disposed to
      do so as rapidly as they become able.

    <h3>
      MISSION SERVICES AT TWO KETTLE VILLAGE.
    </h3>
    <p class="author">
      BY MISS M. M. LICKORISH.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church at Two Kettle Village on the Cheyenne was dedicated
      May 19th. I was delighted to receive an invitation from Mr. Riggs
      to accompany the party from Oahe. We crossed the Missouri River
      in a boat, and on the other side took the carriage that had to be
      sent around by Pierre, an extra distance of thirty-two miles, in
      order to cross on the bridge. Doctor and Mr. Frederick Riggs,
      from Santee, now joined us, and the day being pleasant, the
      prairie covered with the wild flowers so abundant here, we had a
      most delightful drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      About one o'clock we met missionaries and delegates from all
      parts of the Indian field at a place previously agreed upon, and
      there spent a most agreeable hour in social chat, and discussing
      the contents of our lunch boxes. A ride over the prairie is an
      excellent appetizer, and missionaries so exiled most of the time
      from all but a few of their own race, find these occasional
      meetings most pleasant, but having a long ride still before us,
      and a river to ford before dark, we were soon again on our way.
      About sundown we came in sight of the memorial church. It is
      situated on a little hill, and facing the Cheyenne River, and a
      lovely, picturesque valley, rendered more attractive just now by
      the numerous Indian tents scattered singly or in groups over the
      grass near the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before our party reached the ford, two of our missionaries,
      Mrs. Griffiths and Miss Dodge, were driving across, and the river
      being very high, the horse stumbled into a hole, but some Indians
      watching them from the bank went quickly to their assistance.
      They were soon taken ashore in another conveyance, but not before
      getting thoroughly drenched <!-- Page 364 --><a name="Page_364"
      id="Page_364"></a>and gaining the admiration of the Indians for
      their courage. Reaching the camping-ground tired and hungry, it
      was pleasant to find a large new tent, made and erected by the
      Indian women, for the use of the white women of our party. Mr.
      Riggs's larger one, near by, was used by the men. The tents were
      all the round kind, used by Indians, with poles projecting from
      the top, and an opening left for the smoke of our little fire in
      the center, for the cool evenings made a fire very desirable. The
      opening for a door is a little more than three feet high.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wife of the native pastor, Mrs. Phelps, had an abundant and
      appetizing supper ready for us. Our white ladies could but
      express their admiration for the composure and quiet dignity with
      which this Indian woman, who could not speak or understand
      English, entertertained, from Saturday until Monday, about
      thirty-five white people and natives at her table, and in a house
      of one room. She was a Martha we might emulate in this, for
      though careful for the needs and comfort of all, even the group
      of Indian women and children, whom she fed sitting on the floor
      in one corner of the room, while her table was surrounded by her
      most honored guests, she never seemed troubled and anxious, and
      received offered help quietly, never letting her extra duties
      keep her from the meetings. Before we spread our blanket beds in
      the tent, the women brought us dry grass to make them more
      comfortable, and we were all invited into the house each evening
      for worship before retiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sunday morning early we gathered in the neat little white
      chapel, made bright with numerous bouquets of wild flowers from
      the prairie. The grave of Elizabeth Winyan, that noble Indian
      woman whose life was spent in earnest missionary work among her
      own people, is near by, and the church is a fitting memorial. The
      Indians came from far and near, and filled the church till some
      had to sit on the floor for lack of seats, but this they did not
      mind, for, judging by the long hair and Dakota dress, we know
      many were but little used to the customs of civilized life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dedicatory prayer was offered by Doctor Riggs, and then
      followed the examination of two candidates for the
      ministry&mdash;Edwin Phelps, the son of Elizabeth Winyan, and her
      nephew, Elias Gilbert. The services and examinations were all in
      the Dakota language, but the intense interest and earnestness of
      the audience, as well as of those taking part, made them very
      impressive, even to those who hearing could not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short intermission for dinner the council convened, and
      Dr. Riggs, acting as interpreter, so all might understand, the
      examination was concluded, and the two men who have been working
      so acceptably for the Master for some time were ordained to the
      Christian ministry, and received the right hand of fellowship,
      extended by Rev. C.F. Reed, of Pierre. Then followed the double
      wedding of two couples, who wished the sanction of Christian
      marriage to unions entered into according to the customs of their
      people in the past, but which are rapidly passing
      <!-- Page 365 --><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a>away before
      the enlightenment of the present. Several children were then
      brought forward for baptism, and the sacred promises of Christian
      training were made by parents who desire much for their children,
      but who are so unfit to lead, knowing but dimly the way
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, that we might gather more into Christian schools, that
      intelligent as well as earnest Christians may be the leaders
      among these people in the future. Seven members were received
      into the church, and then we gathered a happy Christian
      congregation of two races, but one spirit, around the table of
      our Lord. It was a fitting ending to the delightful, helpful
      services of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a little later, there was still another meeting in the
      evening that will not soon be forgotten by those who were
      present. After the sun went down, in the long twilight that
      lingers so late here, the women gathered in a large circle on the
      green grass for a women's meeting. There were about forty women
      present, including those who formed a row outside, who wore the
      Dakota costume, and wished only to see and hear from outside, and
      come in at last to the feast. The meeting was led by Mrs. T.L.
      Riggs; portions of Scripture were read, prayers offered, and
      remarks made by the Dakota women. All entered heartily into the
      singing, which, like all the services, was in Dakota. Then each
      of the white women present spoke a few words of kindness and
      encouragement to the women, and their remarks were interpreted by
      Mrs. Riggs. After the close of this meeting the men were escorted
      to the center of the circle, and soup, which had been preparing
      in numerous kettles near by, was served to all.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were glad to sit in the circle with those Indian mothers and
      speak to them of their children, our love for them, and how we
      were trying to help them. One could not be in such a typical
      gathering of Indians without noting the intelligent faces and
      strength of character depicted in them. One is continually
      surprised, not at the depravity of this people, but with their
      many good traits, and the progress they are making in the face of
      so many obstacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Monday morning the council listened to reports from the field,
      and then adjourned. We were now soon on our way home. About
      sundown we reached the river opposite Oahe, but it was very much
      swollen and rapid. While we sat on the bank and ate supper from
      what remained in our provision boxes, we saw the young man who
      was to bring a boat across for us, struggling against the
      current. As he seemed unable to cross, we began preparations for
      spending the night there under the clear sky, but at last he
      succeeded in crossing in a little boat, and by much hard work and
      skillful rowing, taking two each time, Mr. T.L. Riggs was able
      before midnight to land most of us on the other side in safety,
      though the swift current and much driftwood made this somewhat
      hazardous. The rest made themselves as comfortable as possible
      without tents, and came over in the morning.

    <h3>
      INDIAN MISSION COLLECTIONS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Not long ago a collection for benevolent purposes was taken among
      the Indians in the church at Fort Berthold. Supt. Hall, of the
      American Missionary Association, writes the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The collection amounts to $15.02, and will be increased by
      out-stations. There were about twenty Indians in the
      congregation, and as all were not there a messenger was sent to
      have another collection taken in the evening at the meeting at
      Deacon Many Bears' house. Our people are always ready to give
      what they can. The boys and girls of the school, thirty-eight in
      number, all took a hand, giving of their allowances or earnings.
      Little lame Bertha wrote her name down for eleven cents, which
      was the 'widow's mite' with her. The names of some of the Indian
      contributors are: Red Fox, Strieby Horn, Little Eagle, Andrew
      Crow, Fighting Bear, Mrs. Two Bears, Mrs. Rough Horn, Mrs. Jack
      Rabbit and Louisa Crow Tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Sunday was a cold one, ten degrees below zero, and some of
      our leading members were camping out on their way with food
      supply from Minot, sixty miles north over a trackless waste of
      snow. One Monday morning Andrew Crow came in on horseback, with
      the result of the previous evening's contribution. We get little
      change here, so we put down the amount to be given on paper, and
      settle the account as we can by exchanges or work. We do not have
      many unpaid subscriptions."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such facts as these abundantly prove that our Indian Christians
      are realizing the responsibility upon them to assist with their
      means in these great missionary movements. If all the churches in
      the land would give according to their ability as generously as
      did this Indian church on the prairie, not one of our benevolent
      societies would need suffer.

      "THE PRESENT DISTRESS."
    </h3>
    <p class="author">
      BY REV. W.C. POND, D.D.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is everywhere, and if in our little corner we feel the first
      impulse to murmur, we hear, forthwith, from the great apostle:
      "There hath no trial taken <i>you</i> but such as is common to
      man." And yet the trial is none the less severe, the distress is
      none the less intense, because it is universal. It may be that
      "misery likes company," though I could never see why, but in this
      instance I can truly say, would that we suffered alone!
    </p>
    <p>
      I foresaw almost six months ago that the universal stringency
      would bring us an empty treasury long before the close of our
      fiscal year. It seemed due in justice to our workers to forewarn
      them of this. I told <!-- Page 367 --><a name="Page_367" id=
      "Page_367"></a>them that I would do my best for them, but that
      for the months of June, July and August this might amount to
      nothing; that I was not allowed, and ought not to be, to use the
      resources of the new year to meet any deficits from the old one,
      and that I was under solemn pledge to one of our chief
      benefactors never to let the mission run in debt. Consequently I
      could not and would not blame them if they ceased work and closed
      the schools. I am proud to say that not one teacher was found to
      accept my proposal. One of them wrote: "I am very sorry you are
      so short of funds. I feel sure that
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>'In some way or other,
        <br /></span> <span>The Lord will provide.'
        <br /></span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      At any rate I shall not join the strikers, but keep right on."
      Another said: "Whatever stops, the work must not stop; pay or no
      pay, I shall keep up the school." Gin Foo King wrote from San
      Bernardino, with a sort of lofty contempt of the unbelief that
      could stop work for lack of pay: "God will take care of us; why
      should we fear?" Joe Dun, the latest addition to our force of
      helpers, and one from whose work for Christ I expect glad
      fruitage right along, replied to my message of deep regret that I
      could forward no salary to him for June services: "You need not
      send money; I have rice." Rice with water to boil it in, is good
      enough, some think, for any Chinaman. Perhaps it is. At any rate
      Joe Dun thinks that if that is all God gives it must be all he
      needs. Nevertheless our helpers, especially in the beginnings of
      service, must work the brain hard, and ought to have brain
      nutriment. And unless I can send something to him now, even his
      rice will fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is thus expressed by some in words has been expressed in
      acts by all. It is a great relief to know that the work is going
      on, and at some points better than ever at this season of the
      year. It is a relief to know that there are no broken promises,
      and no accumulation of debt, involved in my failure to remit. But
      for this, the distress would be intolerable; the trial greater
      than I could possibly bear. But when I bring up the case of some
      of our most faithful and successful workers, and realize the
      fact, which I know to be a fact, that they are dependent on the
      little salaries they are wont to receive from me for very
      subsistence, my forewarning passes out of remembrance, and the
      whole burden rolls down upon my heart. God knows what he is
      doing, and I cast my care upon him and rest. But it seems to me
      that from somewhere the few hundreds of dollars&mdash;not more
      than $500 needed in addition to what I have reason already to
      hope for&mdash;<i>must come</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever it has been possible I have thrown the responsibility of
      sustaining the missions upon the localities in which they are
      situated. And in many cases this responsibility has been assumed
      with a cheerfulness and a generosity, considering the times,
      which has been greatly encouraging <!-- Page 368 --><a name=
      "Page_368" id="Page_368"></a>to me. And I cannot but hope that
      herein will be found one of the compensations for our anxiety and
      pain&mdash;a deeper and more general interest on the part of
      Christian people in this branch of the service of their Lord. One
      of the teachers, giving an account of a meeting which she held in
      the interest of her mission, anticipates such a result and says:
      "I feel sure that my hard, lonesome times are over, and that
      after this I shall have more help and sympathy. Isn't it
      wonderful how doing a hard duty will sometimes straighten out so
      many tangles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I venture to close this little sketch of hard heartwork with
      another quotation from this same teacher: "I sympathize with you
      in not being able to pay us teachers as you would like to do when
      you know how we work. But don't worry any more over me, for I
      shall manage splendidly (as I always do?). I guess you feel a
      good deal worse over it than we teachers do. Sacrifice is in
      order for missionaries and preachers, but we get pay that the
      world knows not of&mdash;rewards as much above money as heaven is
      above earth."

      A FEW WORDS TO BOYS.
    </h4>
    <p>
      The American Missionary Association needs the help of <i>every
      boy</i>. Send to the Bible House, New York, for leaflets that
      will tell what the American Missionary Association is, and what
      it is trying to do, especially for the Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- Page 369 --><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Read the following letter, by Miss Mary P. Lord, our missionary
      among the Sioux Indians, and let us know what you will do to help
      teach Indian boys how to become good men:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dear Boys:</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt you are already interested in Indians, from stories you
      have read of them. And perhaps you think they are very strange
      people, quite unlike white people. In some ways they are. But if
      you could come out here to our little Indian village (Little
      Eagle Village it is called), on the Standing Rock Reservation in
      Dakota, I think you would very soon be playing with the Indian
      boys just as merrily as you do now with your boy friends at home.
      Perhaps Ben Black Dog would show you some of the little gumbo
      images that he made when the mud was soft, and then it grew dry
      and hard, as the clay does that some of you use in school; and
      perhaps he would show you how he makes his life-like horses and
      riders, and buffaloes, and dogs, and all the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day I saw some boys playing with their gumbo figures, and
      heard one of the boys say "akicita," which is the Dakota word for
      "soldier"; so I suppose little Indian boys "play soldier," too!
      Then every Indian boy from the time he is a baby has his pony.
      One ten-year-old boy was telling me the other day what good care
      he tried to take of his pony, and I was very glad he thought
      about it, and knew that his "Charlie" ought to be well cared for.
      All the boys like to ride, but sometimes they forget that their
      ponies ought to be kindly treated, and to have proper food and
      rest. Indian boys have their favorite games, too, just as white
      boys do, only their games are different. One is throwing long,
      slender sticks, which they make in a certain way; but in order to
      know just how they make and throw them, you may have to come and
      see them do it. I am afraid I cannot tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they like to run, and jump, and play together very much as
      you do, only (shall I say it?) I think they are more quiet in
      their playing than many white boys I have seen and <i>heard</i>.
      They are not all alike any more than white boys are. Some are
      naturally very bright and quick to think and to act, and others
      not as much so. Some of the boys and men are diligent and hard
      workers, while others are lazy. Some like to study, and others
      like better to play. A large new Government boarding-school has
      been lately built in our little village for the Dakota boys and
      girls. One very cold day, a boy, perhaps fourteen years old, came
      walking fifteen miles, without overcoat or mittens, and alone, to
      ask if he might be received as a pupil in the new school. I think
      he must be one of the boys who likes to study, and who wants to
      learn. Such boys get ahead. Some Indian boys are naturally very
      gentle in their manner, and although their clothing may be ragged
      and dirty, and the homes in which they live are not nearly so
      bright and attractive as perhaps your father's stable is, yet
      <!-- Page 370 --><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a>these boys
      appear as gentlemanly as if accustomed to the little courtesies
      of the parlor in civilized life. One verse in the Bible says: "As
      he thinketh in his heart, so is he," and I think it is the gentle
      thoughts in the hearts of these Indian boys that make some of
      them so truly <i>gentlemen</i>, notwithstanding their
      surroundings and lack of training.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some things that they say and do are very funny. After one of our
      village boys had been to the new boarding-school two or three
      weeks, he came to our house one day of an errand. While he
      waited, he said to Winona (that is Miss Collins) "Do you sleep on
      a bed the way we do at school?" She told him that she did, and
      then he said: "A long time ago, when I was little and not very
      wise, I used to come here to your house, and I always thought you
      slept on that table [the dining-table] but, now I am beginning to
      see clearly."
    </p>
    <p>
      The same ten-year-old friend gave me a lesson one day in digging
      potatoes. And another time when he had ridden the pony Bessie to
      drink at the river, his younger brother came to the house with
      him. The two are as devoted brothers as any that I know, and when
      I reached out Ben's pay toward him, he motioned me to give it to
      Daniel instead. Very likely it was shared afterward, but at least
      I thought it showed a generous spirit of brotherly love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fourth of July and Christmas are great days here as well as among
      our white friends in the East. This year I had the pleasure of
      attending two Christmas-tree celebrations. The first was at our
      little church Christmas evening. The house was full, some of the
      boys and young men being obliged to sit on the edge of the little
      platform and on the floor, and everybody seemed happy. The next
      evening I drove about six miles, to the Oak Creek Station, to
      share in the festivities at Cross Bear's house. There, too, they
      had a tree, and a Santa Claus dressed up in a big, shaggy, fur
      coat, a very tall hat decorated with Indian designs, and in his
      hand he carried a stout staff on which he leaned, as if he felt
      the burden of many winters. He was just as funny as your Santa
      Claus, as he stood bowing and bowing, and making his little
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indians like to have a good time all together, whether it is
      Fourth of July, or Christmas, or a prayer-meeting, or a feast.
      And we are very thankful that now they enjoy meeting in these
      ways, instead of having the old-time heathen dances. We are
      thankful that when we speak of Indians now, we do not mean a race
      of people who are only waiting for a chance to scalp us. They are
      our friends, as we are theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      God has been revealed to them, and they are coming out of their
      heathen darkness into His light, and they are learning how to
      live purer and better lives, to think new thoughts, and to be
      Christian men instead of heathen savages. We who have always
      known of God, and heard His word, must help them "in His name."
      Think, dear boys, if there is anything that you can do.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
